# Learning F# Prgramming Language

This repository is meant to be where I learn the F# programming language using the course from Udemy called [fsharp from the ground up](https://www.udemy.com/course/fsharp-from-the-ground-up/)

This repository contains the files that the instructor has provided me with. These files are the before and after files. The before is what the assignment looks like before we started and the after is the instructors completed files. I will create a new folder in each lecture where I will place my own code.

The lecturer has recommended that we use dotnet core 3.1 but can use newer versions. I will be using dotnet core 3.1 so I dont run into any problems while learning.
